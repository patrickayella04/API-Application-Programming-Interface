    What Is An API 
    1. Application Programming Interface
    2. Contract provided by one piece of software to another
    3. Structured request and response
    4. We just worked with an API that takes a request and response with jokes (chuck noris project)

    REST APIS
    What is REST?
    1. Represtational State Transfer
    2. Architecture style for designing networked applications
    3. Relies on a Stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
    4.Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
    5. Can be used by virtually any programming language
    6. All APIS have their own rules and structure

    Key: An API is the Messager and REST APIS lets us use HTTP requerst to format that message. 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    HTTP Request
    GET: Retrieve date from a specified resource
    POST: Sunmit data to be processed to a specified resource 
    PUT: Update a specified resource
    DELETE: Delete a specified resource

    Other types of Request are...

    HEAD: Same as get but does not return body, only returns the HEADER
    OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods of that specific server
    PATCH: Update partial resources

    API Endpoints

    When you have some kind of API, whether it's your own, or its an external you will have somehting called End points. The API End points are the URLs that you access to do certai things. A common Endpoint to GET ALL users...see more below

    // some URLs are exactly the same which is fine as they are different methods

    GET http//someurl.com/api/users    // Get all users
    GET http//someurl.com/api/users/1  //Get single user

    not: these next end points you will be sending data along with your request, because it needs to know the post data to add(POST), which post to update(PUT) aswell as the data that you want to update it with. And (DELTE) will delete a user based on the ID passed in the url.

    POST http//someurl.com/api/users   // Add user
    PUT  http//someurl.com/api/users/1  // Udate user
    DELETE http//someurl.com/api/users/1  // Delete user
